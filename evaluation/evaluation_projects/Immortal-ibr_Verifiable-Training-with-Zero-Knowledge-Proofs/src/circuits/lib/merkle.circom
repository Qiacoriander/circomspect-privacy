/*
 * MerkleProofVerifier
 * 
 * Verifies that a leaf belongs to a Merkle tree with a given root using Poseidon hash.
 * 
 * A Merkle tree commitment scheme allows proving membership of a single element
 * in a large dataset without revealing the entire dataset. The proof size is
 * logarithmic: O(log N) where N is the dataset size.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   DEPTH - Height of the Merkle tree
 *           Must satisfy: 2^DEPTH >= number of leaves
 *           Example: DEPTH=7 supports up to 128 leaves, DEPTH=8 supports up to 256
 * 
 * Inputs:
 *   leaf - The hash of the data item at the leaf position
 *   siblings[DEPTH] - Sibling hashes on the path from leaf to root
 *                     siblings[0] is the sibling at the leaf level
 *                     siblings[DEPTH-1] is the sibling just below the root
 *   pathIndices[DEPTH] - Direction bits for each level (0=left child, 1=right child)
 *                        Determines whether current node is left or right of its sibling
 *   root - The expected Merkle root (public commitment)
 * 
 * Security:
 *   - Soundness: Cannot prove false membership without breaking Poseidon collision-resistance
 *   - Zero-knowledge: The proof reveals only the leaf's membership, not its position or neighbors
 * 
 * Constraint count: ~153 * DEPTH (for Poseidon over BN254)

/*
 * MerkleTreeInclusionProof
 * 
 * Proves that a raw value is included in a committed Merkle tree.
 * This is a two-step process:
 *   1. Hash the raw value to get the leaf hash
 *   2. Verify the Merkle path from leaf to root
 * 
 * Why hash the value first?
 *   - Separates leaf values from internal node values (domain separation)
 *   - Prevents attacks where an adversary uses an internal node hash as a "leaf"
 *   - Standard practice in Merkle tree constructions
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   DEPTH - Height of the Merkle tree
 * 
 * Inputs:
 *   value - The actual raw data value (e.g., a label: 0 or 1)
 *   siblings[DEPTH] - Merkle proof siblings
 *   pathIndices[DEPTH] - Path directions
 *   root - Expected Merkle root
 * 
 * Example usage in balance proof:
 *   value = 1 (a binary label)
 *   → leafHash = Poseidon(1)
 *   → Verify path from leafHash to root

/*
 * BatchMerkleProof
 * 
 * Proves that multiple values ALL belong to the same Merkle tree.
 * This is critical for the balance proof: we need to verify that every
 * counted label actually came from the committed dataset, not made up.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   N - Number of values to verify (must match dataset size)
 *   DEPTH - Height of the Merkle tree
 * 
 * Inputs:
 *   values[N] - Array of raw values (e.g., binary labels)
 *   siblings[N][DEPTH] - Merkle proof for each value
 *   pathIndices[N][DEPTH] - Path directions for each value
 *   root - Single Merkle root (all values must belong to this root)
 * 
 * Security guarantee:
 *   If this circuit is satisfied, then ALL N values are authentic members
 *   of the dataset committed to by 'root'. An adversary cannot:
 *   - Add fake values not in the original dataset
 *   - Use values from a different dataset
 *   - Reuse the same value multiple times (if pathIndices are unique)
 * 
 * Constraint count: ~(153 * DEPTH + 1) * N
 *   For N=128, DEPTH=7: ~138,000 constraints
 *   Still tractable for modern SNARK provers (1-5 seconds)

/*
 * USAGE NOTES:
 * 
 * 1. Computing a Merkle root (off-circuit, in JavaScript/Python):
 *    - Hash each leaf: leafHashes[i] = Poseidon(values[i])
 *    - Build tree bottom-up: parent = Poseidon(leftChild, rightChild)
 *    - Top node is the root
 * 
 * 2. Computing a Merkle proof (off-circuit):
 *    - For leaf at index i, collect sibling hashes on path to root
 *    - Record direction at each level (left=0, right=1)
 * 
 * 3. Verification (in-circuit, this file):
 *    - Start with leaf hash
 *    - At each level, hash with sibling in correct order
 *    - Final result must match public root
 * 
 * See: /fl/utils.py for Python implementation of Merkle tree construction
